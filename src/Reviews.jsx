      content: <p>5 stars is less for Momos Point.<br /> For me, Momos Point is the best place to eat Chinese Food. Coming here with my family since I was a kid. The name of the restaurant is Momos Point so obviously the momos will be great. No doubt in it. Momos, Noodles, Rice, Chinese Platter, Stir Fried Vegetables, Thukpa etc Everything here is delicious. I specially love their spring roll sauce. Do visit at once:)</p>,

      content: <p>The food was very good and the portions are apt to the price we pay. Overall nice experience. Only one problem that the lights are too dim so you will definitely struggle with good pictures. As we clicked but due to low light pictures were not clear and up to the mark.<br />We had- veggie pizza (good), Noodles (good quantity),<br />Steam momos (average), chilli potatoes(must try).</p>,

      content: <p>The new outlet of momos point is decked up!<br /> It's big and much better. Food quality remains same. I loved the momo's - specificly masala momos. The Singapore noodles were not great but Rocher shake was nice again. Pricing is moderate in 600, you can have a drink and two items. I will recommend this place to my friends.<br/>Vegetarian options: There are veg options available.</p>,

      content: <p>It is located right at the centre of kamala nagar market.<br />It is usually crowded and you might need to wait a few minutes to get a table. However, the wait is worth it, as the place has great ambience and you will enjoy your time with your friends and/or family. The staff is also very polite and responsive. The menu was is also great and the price is reasonable for the quantity they serve. Overall, had a good experience at the restaurant.</p>,

      content: <p>This has been my favourite place since 2003.<br /> And I ha ve loved it since then. They have become such a big brand now but the good part is that they haven't compromised with the quality. I love this place and never miss eating Steamed Pork Momos from here. Also don't miss their Exotic Shakes. They are thick and super yum.<br />A must visit for great Chinese Cravings.<br />You can't miss them !!!</p>,

      content: <p>A very Nice Place to have Chinese at.<br />It is located near McDonald's, Kamla Nagar. It is a very nice place with good interior. The services were fast & Food tasted really good. And a pocket friendly place. Highly satisfied with this. I orderd Chinese Platter, chessy Fries, An ice cream soda and A nutella shake. The Chinese platter comes with great quantity of Manchurian balls, Momos and Fried Rice or Noddles.</p>,

      content: <p>I kept hearing about this place for a long time.<br />Because i am "food lover", i wanted to go and give this outlet a visit. Finally, i visited the restuarant and i loved this place. Firstly, the crowd and service is great. It is located in a narrow passage but once you taste the food you will forget all the cons. I ordered tandoori momos, garlic noodles, sandwich and all of them were awesome. If I get a chance to visit again, will surely stop by Momos Point.</p>,

      content: <p>Who doesn't love momo's? <br />This place has been one of my favorite places for momo's outing since 2015. I study in Delhi school of economics which is only 5 minutes away from this place. I visit momo's point whenever I have momo's craving and this place never disappoints. You should try their tandoori and steam chicken momo's. Overall it's a nice place with helpful staff and nice ambience.</p>,
